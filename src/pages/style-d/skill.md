# Intent
Bold, vibrant color-block design inspired by CSS Zen Garden's classic aesthetic. Emphasizes strong typographic hierarchy, generous whitespace, and high-contrast color combinations. Creates a cheerful, confident interface that feels both retro and modern.

- Use uppercase labels and headers for visual impact
- Maintain generous padding and spacing between elements
- Apply sharp corners (no border radius) for geometric clarity
- Use minimal shadows; rely on color contrast for depth
- Implement high contrast text (white on dark, dark on light)
- Table should have clean horizontal rules with alternating subtle backgrounds
- Sidebar should be dark navy/charcoal (#2b303b) for strong contrast
- Use yellow (#f8f4d3) blocks for secondary information panels

# Notes
This design draws inspiration from the original CSS Zen Garden aesthetic—celebrating the power of CSS through bold, unapologetic design choices. The color palette is intentionally vibrant and memorable. The layout should feel structured and confident, with each section clearly delineated through color and space. Think of Swiss design meets 90s web optimism.
