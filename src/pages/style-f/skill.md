# Intent
Create a vintage, baroque-inspired interface reminiscent of 19th-century ornamental design and aged manuscripts. This style evokes the elegance of Victorian-era typography and decorative arts, with rich textures, gold accents, and classical ornamental elements that transport users to a bygone era of craftsmanship.

# Style Rules
- Use a dark, textured background with paper/parchment grain effects to create an aged, vintage feel
- Apply sepia and gold color palette (deep browns, aged yellows, muted golds) with high contrast against dark backgrounds
- Incorporate baroque ornamental dividers and decorative flourishes between sections
- Use script/serif typography for headings with ornate capital letters
- Add subtle vignette effects and corner decorations throughout the interface
- Layer semi-transparent aged paper textures over content areas
- Apply gold borders with ornamental corner elements to cards and containers
- Use drop shadows and inner glows to create depth and vintage print effects
- Include floral and scrollwork motifs as background elements
- Apply sepia-toned or desaturated overlays to create unified aged aesthetic
- Use larger border-radius with ornate decorative corners
- Implement vintage button styles with embossed or engraved appearance

# Do
- Use ornamental dividers and decorative elements to separate sections
- Apply layered textures (paper grain, scratches, aged effects) to backgrounds
- Include vintage floral or scrollwork background patterns
- Use elegant serif or script fonts for headings
- Create depth through shadows, glows, and layered elements
- Add subtle animations that feel like page turns or ink fades
- Use gold/sepia color variations for state changes (hover, active, disabled)
- Apply vignette effects to focus attention on content areas

# Don't
- Use bright, saturated modern colors that break the vintage aesthetic
- Apply flat, minimalist design patterns without ornamentation
- Use sans-serif fonts exclusively
- Create sharp, geometric shapes without softening edges
- Ignore texture and depth in favor of pure flat design
- Use modern iconography without vintage styling
- Apply neon or high-contrast accent colors
- Create animations that feel digital or futuristic

# Notes
- The goal is to create an interface that feels like a beautifully crafted artifact from the Victorian era
- Balance ornamentation with readability - decorative elements should enhance, not overwhelm
- Consider using CSS blend modes to create authentic aged paper effects
- Background images should feel integral to the design, not just decorative overlays
- Maintain accessibility by ensuring sufficient contrast despite the vintage aesthetic
- Use opacity and layering to create the illusion of aged, semi-transparent vellum or parchment
